# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. Tell me a little bit about yourself and your interest in games! Be sure to include your preferred name and pronouns, and talk a little bit about what games you like to play, why you’re taking the class, any prior experience you have with game development, and what kind of games you hope to build.

    My name is Quinn(He/Him/His). Ive been interested in making games since I was pretty young because of how much I liked to play them. I started taking private coding lessons in 7th grade and have consistently been taking classes in programming since then which all started because I loved games so much and wanted to learn how theyre made. My favorite game to play is probably League(unfortunately) but I play all kinds of things as I just love games in general. Ive used Unity on a very basic level in the past but nothing to any significant extent. Im taking this class because I want to develop my skills so that I will be able to make games on my own without having to watch a thousand YouTube tutorials just to be able to get a sprite to move how I want it to. In terms of games that I hope to build, one dream would be a game in the same style of Undertale, a game that has a lot of meaning behind it and is more about the story and writing(and music) than anything else. A game that can pull people into the story like that and leave them with an entirely personalized expierience compared to other players despite the core gameplay being relatively the same is such an amazing achievement. Another thing that the Dungeons & Dragons player in me would love to be a part of would be a game like Skyrim that was finally made with modern technology. Skyrim was such an amazing game for its time and I feel like even though its over a decade old it still holds up with games being released today. Baldur's Gate 3 is the first game that Ive felt has really taken on the same size and re-playability and while BG3 probably outdoes Skyrim in that sense it operates in a top-down perspective. I would love to be a part of the making of a massive open world singleplayer RPG with a first/third perspective that allows the player to have as much freedom as possible and gives every person that plays it a unique expierience. Besides, with the visual effects we have nowadays we could make a fireball spell look so much cooler. 

2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. What are you hoping to get out of this class?
    I want to learn about the process behind game development and gain skills that grant me some competency on my own rather than having to rely on online tutorials at every step of the way.
4. What, if anything, are you nervous about for this class?
    Something that I am nervous about not just in this class but in this major in general is that Ive heard how difficult the game industry can be to enter into and find a stable job in so that concerns me. Im looking into the possibility of a double major but oh boy thats a lot of work.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
    Ive had classes in Python and Java(mostly Java) and have used C# a very small amount.

2. Game development (any engine)
    Ive used Unity a small amount in a summer course I took in high school

3. Unity
    A little bit of using the basics. Adding components, physics, collisions, movement, etc.

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
    I would guess that maybe it is a document of either the process of what steps it takes to make a game(a similar idea to a dev log) or maybe a breakdown of what work is being done by which members of a team.

2. Scope management
    If it means scope as in the CS term, I would guess it means managing the variables and values within the code to ensure that a value that you need in once scene for example can be accessed from a different scene in the game. If the scope is wrong, then it can cause variable conflicts and you may not be able to access the value of a variable that you need.

3. Iteration
    Im having trouble defining the word exactly but in this context it could mean a version of a game. Each seperate unfinished version, update, or patch could be considered its own iteration of the game. It also can be used in programming when talking about a run-through of a program, loop, or object definition. 

4. Object-Oriented programming
    Java is an object-orientated language so I should definitely know how to explain this(emphasis on "should"). It involves using "objects" that you create to use code. In Java, code has to be written within a method which is a kind of object which you can then call later to run the same previously written code again. Its based around that kind of object interaction. It gets more complicated when dealing with inheritance and utilizing multiple classes but I think thats a basic example.

5. Model-View-Controller architecture
    N/A
